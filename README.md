# 0x1B. C - Sorting algorithms & Big O

## üìö Description

This project focuses on implementing several classic **sorting algorithms** in C, analyzing their **Big O complexity**, and understanding their behavior through **step-by-step printing** after each swap.

---

## üß† Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, we are expected to be able to explain:

- At least four different sorting algorithms
- What is the Big O notation, and how to evaluate time complexity
- How to select the best sorting algorithm for a given input
- What is a stable sorting algorithm
- The difference between in-place and non in-place algorithms

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Requirements

- Code compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 using:  
  `gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror -pedantic -std=gnu89`
- No global variables
- No usage of standard library functions (`printf`, `puts`, etc.) unless specified
- Use of `print_array` and `print_list` functions provided by Holberton
- Maximum of 5 functions per file
- Betty-compliant code style and documentation

## üß™ How to Test

Each `.c` file has a corresponding `main.c` example provided. To test:

```bash
gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror -pedantic 0-bubble_sort.c 0-main.c print_array.c -o bubble
./bubble
